ZoomacIt is a native macOS menu bar app inspired by [ZoomIt for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit).
The project aims for feature compatibility with ZoomIt, providing system-wide hotkeys, smooth zooming, and on-screen annotation while minimizing required permissions.

### Zoom

Press **⌃1** (Control+1) to enter Zoom mode. The screen is captured and you can zoom in/out and pan around.

#### Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Mouse move | Pan |
| Scroll wheel / ↑↓ | Zoom in / out |
| Click | Enter Draw mode (zoomed view becomes the drawing canvas) |
| Escape | Exit Zoom mode (or return to Zoom if entered from Draw) |
| Right-click | Exit Zoom mode |

#### Zoom → Draw → Zoom flow

When you click in Zoom mode, you enter Draw mode on top of the zoomed view. Pressing **Escape** in Draw mode returns to Zoom mode (2-step dismiss, similar to text mode). Pressing **Escape** again exits Zoom entirely.

### Draw

Press **⌃2** (Control+2) to enter Draw mode. The screen freezes and you can draw on top of it.

#### Drawing

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Drag | Freehand drawing |
| Shift + Drag | Straight line |
| Control + Drag | Rectangle |
| Tab + Drag | Ellipse |
| Shift + Control + Drag | Arrow |

#### Colors

| Key | Color |
|---|---|
| R | Red (default) |
| G | Green |
| B | Blue |
| O | Orange |
| Y | Yellow |
| P | Pink |
| Shift + color key | Highlighter mode |

#### Tools

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| T | Text input mode |
| ⌃ + scroll wheel | Change pen width |
| E | Erase all |
| W | Whiteboard background |
| K | Blackboard background |

#### Actions

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ⌘Z | Undo |
| ⌘C | Copy to clipboard |
| ⌘S | Save to file |
| Space | Center cursor |
| Escape | Exit text mode (confirm text) / Exit Draw mode |
| Right-click | Exit Draw mode |

#### Text mode

Press **T** to enter text mode. Click anywhere to place a text field and start typing.

- **Click another position** — the current text is confirmed (rasterized) and a new text field is placed
- **Escape** — confirms the current text and returns to pen mode (Draw mode stays active)
- **Scroll wheel** — change font size
- **Color keys** (R/G/B/O/Y/P) — change text color
- **Right-click** — confirms the current text and exits Draw mode

### Break Timer

Press **⌃3** (Control+3) to start a break timer. A full-screen countdown appears and starts immediately with the default duration (10 minutes).

#### Timer Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| ↑ | Add 1 minute |
| ↓ | Subtract 1 minute |
| R / G / B / O / Y / P | Change timer text color |
| Escape | Dismiss timer |

#### Behavior

- The timer starts immediately when the hotkey is pressed — no confirmation dialog
- Adjusting time with ↑/↓ works even during countdown
- When the timer reaches **0:00**, it stays on screen and shows elapsed time below (e.g., `0:00 (1:15)`)
- The timer continues running in the background when switching to other apps
- You can also start the timer from the menu bar icon → **Break**
- Draw mode (⌃2) and Break Timer (⌃3) can run simultaneously

## Development

The project uses Swift 6 + AppKit, targeting macOS 26+. The Xcode project is generated by [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) from `src/project.yml`.

```bash
make build       # Debug build
make test        # Run unit tests
make run         # Build and launch the app
make release     # Release build (Developer ID signed)
make notarize    # Release build + Apple notarization
make dmg VERSION=1.0.0  # Notarize + create distributable DMG
make clean       # Clean build artifacts
make generate    # Regenerate .xcodeproj (after editing src/project.yml)
```

### Code signing and notarization

macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps downloaded from the internet. To distribute ZoomacIt without requiring users to bypass Gatekeeper warnings, the app must be signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_ID` | Your Apple ID email address |
| `TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID (used by `make release` / `make notarize`) |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | An [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654) generated at appleid.apple.com |

Then run:

```bash
make dmg VERSION=1.0.0
```

This builds a Release binary signed with your Developer ID, submits it to Apple for notarization, staples the notarization ticket, and packages the result into a distributable DMG.

> **Note:** Notarization requires an [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership. The `.env` file is gitignored and must never be committed.
